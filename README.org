This monorepo contains all public software projects I've developed and released to the community.

Each project is maintained within a structured architecture that enables efficient development, testing, and deployment while promoting code reuse and standardization across projects.

* JS
- [[file:link-preview/][Link preview]] :: Browser extension to preview link metadata (title and description) on hover, saving you time to open many tabs just to preview the link!
- [[file:text-saver/][Text saver]] :: Browser extension to save texts anytime, anywhere.
* Python
- [[file:zigcc/][Zig CC]] :: Scripts aimed at simplifying the use of =zig cc= for compiling C, C++, Rust, and Go programs.
- [[file:compress-video/][Video-compress]] :: Compress video by 90% without losing much quality, similar to what [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley_(TV_series)][Pied Piper]] achieves.
